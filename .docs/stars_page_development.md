# /stars Page Development

This document tracks the development of the `/stars` page.

## Features:
- [x] Basic page structure with "Donate" button.
- [ ] Ko-fi integration to display donations.
- [ ] 3D explorable star constellation.

## Ko-fi Integration

We will embed the Ko-fi feed. The typical method involves an iframe or a script provided by Ko-fi. 
A placeholder Ko-fi username `YOUR_KOFI_USERNAME` is currently used in the donate link.

## 3D Star Constellation

This feature will require a JavaScript library for 3D graphics (e.g., Three.js, p5.js in WebGL mode, or a dedicated particle library).

**Considerations:**
- Performance: Ensure the animation is smooth and doesn't degrade page load or interaction.
- Data Source: How will the stars be generated? Randomly? Based on actual donation data (e.g., number of stars = number of donations)?
- Interactivity: Pan, zoom, hover effects on stars (maybe showing donor names or messages if Ko-fi API allows and privacy is handled).
