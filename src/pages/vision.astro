                North Star AGI exists for the engineers, the innovators, and those with drive but without resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                We highlight local talent. We share cutting-edge knowledge. We build.
            </p>
            <p>
                At every AI talk in Antwerp, the same questions: "Is Europe behind?" "What about the AI race?" - these topics are important to discuss but talk is meaningless without action.
            </p>
            <p>
                North Star AGI is our answer. A hands-on community, to connect the Belgian AI ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
                We started from nothing. Alone. Now others with the same vision are finding and joining us. We're growing fast with over 150 members involved, 4 events hosted in just 4 months and a team obsessed with the vision of someday seeing Belgium and Europe at the forefront of the AI revolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                The spark of ambition burns in everyone. In Europe, we have a problem of friction. North Star fights anyway - and helps others do the same. We aim to glue the different communities together, and create something that has never been seen before.
            </p>
            <p>
                A community is its people. We need you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Europe's springtime is here. The ecosystem awakens. Urgency spreads.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl font-medium text-blue-400">
                It's now or never.
