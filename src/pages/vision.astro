                Europe is at a critical moment in AI. Falling behind isn’t an option. We need to build an independent, strong AI ecosystem—starting now.
            </p>
            <p>
                At North Star AGI, we’re focused on building Artificial General Intelligence—AI that can think, learn, and create across fields. That goal drives everything we do.
            </p>
            <p>
                We care about results. We're building a hands-on community where engineers, researchers, students, and builders team up to shape Europe’s AI future. You don’t need a perfect résumé—just grit, curiosity, and time. We’ll back you with resources and people.
            </p>

                We’ve already kicked things off—our first Antwerp hackathon pulled in over 60 people and got the local scene moving in just two months.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our next hackathon is May 10. This is only the start. We’re building an AI hub that draws global talent—with real work, not fluff.
            </p>
            <p>
                This needs all of us. If you think Europe should lead in AI, join us.
