                North Star AGI started as a community focused on the engineers, the innovators, and those with the drive but without the resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                We highlight local talent and share the latest knowledge in the world of AI and robotics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why do this? During the many AI talks here in Antwerp, questions that often come up are: "Is Europe behind in AI?" and "What do you think about Europe and the AI race?"
            </p>
            <p>
                North Star AGI is our answer to this. We are laying the foundations for a strong Belgium and Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
                We started from scratch and alone, but we started, and now people with the same vision are joining and learning about us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every European has a spark of ambition in their blood; the friction around us keeps suppressing it. North Star finds a way to fight nonetheless.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're all in this together. A community doesn't exist without its people, and we need you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Europe's springtime is coming. The ecosystems are waking up, and a sense of urgency is spreading.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl font-medium text-blue-400">
                It's now or never.
